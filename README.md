# Tim-zone API: Real-time Chatting Platform

## Project Intention

The **Tim-zone API** serves as the backend infrastructure for a real-time chatting platform. My primary intention is to build a robust, scalable, and efficient API using Java technologies to handle the core functionalities required for a seamless and engaging user experience. This API will be the central hub for managing user accounts, handling message delivery, maintaining chat channels, and ensuring real-time communication between users on the frontend (built with React).

## Core Goals

* **Real-time Communication:** Implement technologies that enable instant message delivery between users without constant polling or manual refreshes.
* **Scalability:** Design the API architecture to handle a growing number of users and concurrent connections efficiently.
* **User Management:** Provide secure and reliable mechanisms for user registration, login, and profile management.
* **Channel Management:** Allow users to create, join, and manage different chat channels (public and private).
* **Message Persistence:** Securely store chat messages to ensure they are available to users, even after disconnection.
* **Security:** Implement appropriate authentication and authorization measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Extensibility:** Design the API in a modular way to allow for future feature additions, such as media sharing, user presence indicators, and more.
* **Integration with React Frontend:** Ensure smooth and efficient communication between this Java backend and the React-based frontend application.

## Technologies Planned

* **Java:** The core programming language for its performance, scalability, and extensive ecosystem.
* **Spring Framework (Boot/Web/WebSocket):** Leverage Spring's capabilities for building the API, handling web requests, and implementing WebSocket for real-time communication. Spring Boot will streamline the setup and configuration.
* **WebSocket:** The primary protocol for enabling bidirectional, real-time communication between the backend and the frontend.
* **Database: (MySQL):** To persist user data, chat messages, and channel information. The specific choice will depend on the project's evolving needs for relational or non-relational data.
* **Authentication and Authorization: Spring Security:** To secure the API endpoints and manage user access. JSON Web Tokens 
* **Build Tool (Maven):** To manage project dependencies and build the application.
* **Testing Framework (JUnit):** To ensure the reliability and correctness of the API through unit and integration tests.


## API Endpoints (Anticipated)

While subject to change as development progresses, here are some initial API endpoints I envision:

* `/api/auth/register`: User registration.
* `/api/auth/login`: User login and authentication.
* `/api/auth/me`: Get the currently authenticated user's information.
* `/api/users/{userId}`: Get information about a specific user.
* `/api/channels`: Get a list of available public channels.
* `/api/channels`: Create a new channel.
* `/api/channels/{channelId}`: Get details of a specific channel.
* `/api/channels/{channelId}/join`: Join a specific channel.
* `/api/channels/{channelId}/leave`: Leave a specific channel.
* `/ws/chat`: WebSocket endpoint for real-time message exchange within channels.
* `/api/messages/{channelId}`: Get historical messages for a specific channel.
* `/api/messages/{channelId}`: Send a new message to a channel.

## Integration with React Frontend

The React frontend will interact with this API using standard HTTP requests for user authentication and channel management. For real-time messaging, the frontend will establish a WebSocket connection with the `/ws/chat` endpoint. The API will be designed to handle messages received from the frontend and broadcast them to the appropriate users within the respective chat channels. Data will likely be exchanged in JSON format.

## Future Considerations

* **Private Messaging:** Implementing direct, one-on-one chat between users.
* **Media Sharing:** Allowing users to send images, videos, and other files.
* **User Presence:** Indicating whether users are online or offline.
* **Notifications:** Alerting users to new messages or events.
* **Search Functionality:** Enabling users to search through messages or channels.

This Tim-zone API is a crucial component of my larger goal to build a functional and engaging chatting platform. I am committed to developing a well-structured, efficient, and maintainable backend that effectively supports the real-time communication needs of the frontend application.
